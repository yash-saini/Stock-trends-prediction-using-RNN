# Stock-trends-prediction-using-LSTM
This project uses RNN model here to predict the trends using historical stock data obtained through yahoo finance of "Google"firm from 2012-2017. 60 timestamps (3 months) were used to predict the following day's price. Various LSTM layers were added and 100 epochs with 32 batch size were used to train the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) . The stock data of January 2017 was used as the test data. And the final graph was plotted between the real prices v/s the predicted prices.
